Without credible evidence of what works, funders recycle failed approaches, practitioners lose institutional memory, and the communities these programmes claim to serve bear the cost of well-intentioned guesswork.

It cannot tell us why mothers in one district trusted the community health workers while those in the neighbouring district did not. That second question often matters more for scale-up.
